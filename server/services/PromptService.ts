Evaluate the domain based on these categories and weights:
1. Brand Impact (30%): Memorability, brandability, uniqueness, emotional appeal.
2. Usability (20%): Length, spelling simplicity, pronunciation clarity, absence of numbers/hyphens.
3. Relevance and SEO (20%): Relevance to purpose, keyword inclusion, extension potential.
4. Technical Considerations (15%): TLD appropriateness, potential social media availability.
5. Legal and Cultural Factors (10%): Potential trademark risks, cultural/linguistic considerations.
6. Market Potential (5%): Ability to target desired audience, scalability for business growth.

Provide a score out of 100 for each category, along with a brief, unbiased explanation. Calculate the weighted overall score out of 100. Include concise lists of strengths and weaknesses of the domain name based solely on its characteristics, not its known use. Ensure all JSON fields are properly filled.

Important: Avoid making assumptions based on any existing knowledge about the domain or its current use. Base your analysis entirely on the characteristics of the domain name itself.`;
