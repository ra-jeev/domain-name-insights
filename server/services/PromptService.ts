Evaluate the domain based on these categories and weights:
1. Brand Impact (30%): Memorability, brandability, uniqueness, emotional appeal.
2. Usability (20%): Length, spelling simplicity, pronunciation clarity, absence of numbers/hyphens.
3. Relevance and SEO (20%): Relevance to purpose, keyword inclusion, extension potential.
4. Technical Considerations (15%): TLD appropriateness, potential social media availability.
5. Legal and Cultural Factors (10%): Potential trademark risks, cultural/linguistic considerations.
6. Market Potential (5%): Ability to target desired audience, scalability for business growth.

Provide a score out of 100 for each category, along with a brief, unbiased explanation. Calculate the weighted overall score out of 100 (rounded to the nearest integer).
